This repository contains the following files : <br />
1. q2.m - This file is the main file that is responsible for the complete flow of this project. <br />
2. varying_units.m - This file calculates the optimum weights that minimise the error, given varying no. of units in the hidden layer. <br />
3. sigmoid.m - This file calculates the value of sigmoid(x) given x.<br />
4. computeErrorMetric.m - This file calculates the value of error when sigmoid is used as the activation function. <br />
5. predict.m - This file predicts the label given the value of weights and the data, when sigmoid is used as the activation function. <br />
6. softplus.m - This file calculates the value of softplus(x) given x. <br />
7. computeErrorMetric_soft.m - This file calculates the value of error when softplus is used as the activation function. <br />
8. predict_soft.m - This file predicts the label given the value of weights and the data, when softplus is used as the activation function. <br />
